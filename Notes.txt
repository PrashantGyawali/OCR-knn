KNN doesnot have a training step instead it is a lazy learning algorithm
Usually X means dataset and Y means our labels

Hyperparameters are external configuration variables used to manage machine learning model training. Sometimes called model hyperparameters, the hyperparameters are manually set before training a model.
Basically some constant that we will tune to make it work
